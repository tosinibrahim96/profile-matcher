# Profile Matcher

> Laravel application for matching user profiles to real estate properties.


**Acceptance criteria:**
- microservice should have only one GET endpoint "`api/match/{propertyId}`"
- Response should have the following structure:

```php
"data" => [
	["searchProfileId" => {id}, "score" => {matchScore}, "strictMatchesCount" => {counter},"looseMatchesCount" => {counter}],
	["searchProfileId" => {id}, "score" => {matchScore}, "strictMatchesCount" => {counter},"looseMatchesCount" => {counter}],
	["searchProfileId" => {id}, "score" => {matchScore}, "strictMatchesCount" => {counter},"looseMatchesCount" => {counter}],
	[...],
	[...],
	[...]
]
```

- The response should be ordered by "score" with the highest value on the top
- The response should include only matched SearchProfiles.

### Search Profile is considered matching when:

- At least one SearchProfile field is matching (strict or loose match)
- No field is miss matching
- Any amount of Search profile fields can be missing.

Example of the valid Search Profile match (for the Property described in the example):

```php
SearchProfile {
"name" => "Looking for any Awesome realestate!",
"propertyType" => "d44d0090-a2b5-47f7-80bb-d6e6f85fca90",
"searchFields" => [
	"price" => ["0","2000000"]
}
```

`price` field is a strict match (1500000 is between 0 and 2000000).

`Area`, `yearOfConstruction` and `rooms` Property fields are missing from the Search Profile

No search Profile fields are miss matching.
